Aunthentication and Authorization
HTTP is stateless

we start by installing JWT(JSON Web Toke) 
pip install flask-jwt-extended

to get a secret key you run python3 
on the prompt you write >> import os; os.urandom(15).hex()

next we install;
pip install flask-restful

for passwords to be hashed you need to use Bcrypt and we install it by;
pip install flask-bcrypt
